VISS is a simulation system for viral infection. It is a C++-based system that uses a combination of probabilistic models to study the behavior of viruses their growth and decay over time and their impact on human populations.

### Getting Started

To get started with VISS, you will need to have a C++ compiler and CMake installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and build the system using the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4
```
