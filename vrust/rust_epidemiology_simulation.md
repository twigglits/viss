### User Input

In this folder we are starting from scratch completely. I want to build an epidemiology simulation model in Rust. Before we start building it, share some insight into the latest and most accurate mathematical formulas that have been used to accurately simulate an epidemiological outbreak.

### Planner Response

Here’s a concise overview of the most widely used and accurate mathematical formulations for simulating infectious disease outbreaks, along with when and why to use each. I’ll group them by modeling paradigm and include the core equations you’d likely implement in Rust.

Key takeaway: the most accurate models for a given outbreak blend a mechanistic transmission model (compartmental ODEs, agent-based, or renewal) with realistic heterogeneity (e.g., age/mixing, superspreading), data linkage (observation models), and time-varying parameters (e.g., Rt, seasonality, interventions). Accuracy comes as much from the model structure and parameterization as from the “formula.”

1) Compartmental mechanistic models (ODE/CTMC)
- What: SIR/SEIR and extensions, often with births/deaths, waning immunity, vaccination, and multiple stages to capture realistic waiting times.
- When: Medium-to-large populations where well-mixed or stratified mixing is acceptable. Great for scenario analysis and policy.
- Core SEIR with demography, waning immunity, and vaccination
  dS/dt = μN − λ(t) S − v(t) S + ω R − μ S
  dE/dt = λ(t) S − σ E − μ E
  dI/dt = σ E − γ I − μ I
  dR/dt = γ I + v(t) S − ω R − μ R
  where:
  - λ(t): force of infection
  - μ: per-capita birth/death rate (demographic turnover)
  - v(t): vaccination rate to R with efficacy folded in (or send a fraction to R)
  - σ: rate 1/incubation period
  - γ: rate 1/infectious period
  - ω: waning-immunity rate

- Force of infection (well-mixed)
  λ(t) = β(t) I(t) / N(t)
  with β(t) possibly time-varying due to behavior, seasonality, or NPIs.

- Multiple-stage (Erlang) compartments for realistic dwell times
  Replace E with E1…Ek and I with I1…Iℓ to approximate gamma/Erlang distributions:
  dE1/dt = λ S − kσ E1 − μ E1
  dEi/dt = kσ E(i−1) − kσ Ei − μ Ei  for i=2..k
  Similar for I-stages with ℓ and γ. This improves realism over exponential waiting times.

- Age-structured or group-structured SEIR with contact matrix C
  For age group a:
  λa(t) = β(t) Σ_b C_ab I_b(t) / N_b(t)
  Then run SEIR equations per group a with group-specific parameters if needed.
  This approach is a gold standard for realistic population heterogeneity.

- Reproduction numbers via next-generation matrix
  Construct F (new infections) and V (transitions), then
  R0 = spectral radius ρ(F V^{-1})
  For time-varying, often compute instantaneous Rt by replacing β with β(t).

- Stochastic version (CTMC)
  Same compartments, but transitions are events with propensities. Simulate with Gillespie SSA or tau-leaping. Important for small populations and early outbreak variability.

2) Renewal equation models (generation-interval based)
- What: Models incidence directly using the generation (or serial) interval distribution. Widely used for real-time Rt estimation and forecasting.
- When: You have incidence time series and want robust inference/forecasting with fewer mechanistic assumptions.
- Continuous-time renewal
  I(t) = Rt ∫_0^∞ I(t − τ) w(τ) dτ
  where w(τ) is the generation-interval distribution (e.g., Gamma(mean g, sd s)).
- Discrete-time renewal (practical for implementation)
  I_t ~ Poisson( Rt Σ_{s=1}^S I_{t−s} w_s )
  Rt can be modeled as piecewise constant or a random walk. This is the backbone of popular real-time Rt methods.

- Euler–Lotka (early phase growth linking r, R0, w)
  1 = R0 ∫_0^∞ e^{−rτ} w(τ) dτ
  Useful for initial growth-rate estimates of R0 with known w(τ).

3) Early outbreak branching-process models
- What: Offspring distribution around mean R (or Rt) to capture extinction probability and superspreading.
- When: Very early phase in small populations or introduction events.
- Negative binomial offspring (superspreading)
  P(N = n) = Γ(n + k) / (Γ(k) n!) (k/(k+R))^k (R/(k+R))^n
  - R: mean number of secondary infections
  - k: dispersion (smaller k → more superspreading)
  This captures overdispersion observed in pathogens like SARS‑CoV‑2.

4) Spatial and mobility-aware models
- Metapopulation (multi-patch SEIR)
  Couple multiple locations i with a mobility matrix M_ij (e.g., commuting, airline):
  λ_i(t) = β(t) Σ_j C_ij I_j / N_j
  Then run SEIR per patch with coupling via C_ij or explicit movement flows.
- Reaction–diffusion PDEs
  ∂S/∂t = −λ(x,t) S + D_S ∇²S, etc.
  Useful for spatial spread with local diffusion-like movement.

5) Observation and data linkage (state-space models)
- What: Connect latent infections to observed cases, hospitalizations, deaths.
- When: Calibrating to real data and forecasting.
- Typical likelihoods
  Cases_t ~ NegBinon(mean = ρ I_t (or convolution with delay), overdispersion = φ)
  Deaths_t ~ NegBinon(mean = IFR × infections shifted by delay distribution, φ)
  Hospitalizations often via stage-structured pathways with distinct delays.
- Delays as convolutions with phase-type distributions
  Use Erlang/gamma to represent onset-to-report, onset-to-hospitalization, etc., for realistic lag structures.

6) Time variation, seasonality, and interventions
- Time-varying transmission
  β(t) = β0 × s(t) × b(t) × m(t)
  - s(t): seasonality (e.g., 1 + a cos(2π t/365))
  - b(t): behavior/policy (NPI) effects
  - m(t): mobility/contact scaling
- Testing/isolation effects
  Reduce effective infectiousness by factor q(t) for detected-and-isolated cases.
- Vaccination and waning immunity
  Move S → R at v(t) with efficacy e(t); include waning ω for SIRS/SEIRS dynamics.
- Multi-strain/variant models
  Split compartments per strain; cross-immunity matrix χ governs susceptibility to other strains.

7) Parameter inference and model fitting
- Frequentist: Maximum likelihood with gradient-based optimization; profile likelihood for uncertainty.
- Bayesian: HMC/Stan for ODE-based models; particle MCMC for state-space/stochastic models; SMC/particle filters for online.
- ABC: When likelihoods are intractable but simulation is feasible.
- Identifiability: Use priors and informative data (e.g., hospitalization/death with delays) to pin down parameters.

8) Which formulations are most accurate in practice?
- For policy and mechanistic realism: Age-structured, Erlang-stage SEIRS with time-varying β(t), vaccination, waning, and a contact matrix C. Stochasticity if populations are small or early.
- For real-time Rt estimation and short-term forecasting: Renewal models with well-specified generation-interval and robust observation models.
- For early introductions and superspreading: Branching processes with negative binomial offspring.
- For spatial spread: Metapopulation SEIR with mobility matrices; optionally reaction–diffusion for local spread.

Suggested minimal “starter” model to build first in Rust
- Deterministic age-structured SEIRS with:
  - Erlang E and I stages (e.g., k=2–3)
  - Time-varying β(t) via spline or piecewise constant modifiers
  - Contact matrix C (start with a toy matrix, later replace with real data)
  - Vaccination v(t) and waning ω
  - Observation model mapping infections to reported cases with a delay distribution and negative binomial noise
- Extension paths: stochastic CTMC with Gillespie, metapopulation coupling, renewal-equation variant for Rt estimation.

Would you like me to scaffold a Rust crate that supports:
- Deterministic ODE SEIRS with age structure and Erlang stages
- Pluggable contact matrix, vaccination, and waning
- A simple observation model (cases via delayed convolution + NegBin)
- A renewal-equation module for Rt/forecasting

If so, I’ll set up the project with a clean API, unit tests for the math pieces, and examples (e.g., single-age vs. two-age demos), so we can iterate quickly.

### User Input

ok so which one of these models is the most simple to implement given that I'm taking a specific approach  of pulling in open source population data from the worldpop platform.
I want the kind of model that exceeds in performance and explainability. And yet still gives an accurate enough simulation result.

### Planner Response

Short answer: a deterministic age-structured SEIRS ODE model (with optional Erlang-stage compartments) using a contact matrix is your best starting point. It’s simple to implement, extremely fast, highly explainable, and accurate enough for most policy-style simulations—especially when paired with WorldPop for population sizes by age and location.

Why this model fits your goals
- Performance: ODE SEIRS runs in milliseconds to seconds even for hundreds of strata. It scales linearly with the number of compartments and is cache-friendly; great for scenario sweeps and parameter fitting.
- Explainability: Every term maps to an interpretable process (exposure, incubation, infectiousness, recovery, waning, vaccination). You can point to the contact matrix to explain mixing, and to β(t) modifiers to explain interventions.
- Accuracy (enough): Age structure plus a realistic contact matrix captures most heterogeneity that matters for outcomes and policy. Adding Erlang stages removes the memoryless artifact of simple SEIR. If needed, you can later add spatial coupling between locations.

Recommended baseline model to implement
- State per age group a:
  - SEIRS with kE, kI Erlang stages to approximate realistic dwell times
  - Demography optional if running short horizons
- Force of infection with contact matrix C (from Prem et al. or country-specific sources):
  λ_a(t) = β(t) Σ_b C_ab I_b(t)/N_b
- Dynamics (sketch):
  - E-stages: E1…EkE with rate kE·σ between stages
  - I-stages: I1…IkI with rate kI·γ between stages
  - S → E at rate λ_a(t) S_a
  - I → R at γ, R → S at waning ω (optional)
  - Vaccination v_a(t) sending S to R (optional)
- Time variation:
  β(t) = β0 × m(t), where m(t) is a piecewise-constant multiplier for NPIs/behavior or a smooth spline.
- Observation model (optional but useful):
  Cases_t,a ~ NegBin(mean = ρ_a × [conv(infections_a, report_delay)], overdispersion = φ)

How to use WorldPop effectively
- Pull population counts by age and location:
  - If gridded: aggregate WorldPop raster cells into your chosen spatial units (e.g., admin-1/2). For a non-spatial baseline, sum to national level.
  - If age-specific rasters are available, use those; otherwise split totals using census/UN WPP age pyramids.
- Start non-spatial: one national (or region) model with age groups.
- Upgrade to spatial later: treat each admin unit as a “patch” with its own age-structured SEIRS, coupled by a mobility matrix (e.g., commuting, gravity, or radiation). This keeps the core ODE logic unchanged.

Why not alternatives (given your goals)
- Renewal model: simplest and very fast, but weaker mechanistic interpretability and harder to incorporate age/contact structure cleanly. Great for Rt, less so for explanatory simulation tied to population structure.
- Branching process: excellent for early introductions and superspreading, but not ideal for ongoing population-level simulations.
- Full agent-based: high explainability at the micro level but heavy engineering and compute; slower to get to a robust, calibrated result.

Minimal data you need to start
- Age groups definition (e.g., 0–4, 5–9, …, 75+).
- Population by age group N_a from WorldPop (+ possibly UN WPP for age splits).
- Contact matrix C_ab (use Prem et al. 2017 matrices; country-specific, work/home/school/other).
- Clinical parameters with uncertainty:
  - Incubation mean (~1/σ), infectious period (~1/γ)
  - Optional: waning ω, vaccine efficacy and v_a(t)
  - Optional: reporting fraction ρ_a and delay distribution for observation model
- Intervention schedule as β multipliers m(t) if you want time-varying transmission.

Concrete implementation plan in Rust
- Math:
  - Represent state as a flat vector over [age × stages × compartments].
  - Implement a fixed-step RK4 integrator (simple, fast, deterministic). We can add adaptive later if needed.
  - Use `ndarray` or `nalgebra` for vector/matrix ops; `nalgebra` is fine for C·I.
- API:
  - `ModelConfig` with age bins, contact matrix, parameters, and schedules (β multipliers, vaccination).
  - `State` struct with references/slices to S, E stages, I stages, R per age.
  - `step(dt)` and `simulate(t_end, dt)` functions.
- I/O:
  - Load WorldPop-derived `N_a` from CSV/GeoPackage aggregate.
  - Load `C_ab` from CSV (Prem et al.).
- Tests:
  - Mass conservation.
  - No-mixing edge cases (C = I).
  - Erlang vs. single-stage: same mean period, different variance.
  - Reproduction number sanity: match implied R0 from β, C, σ, γ via next-generation matrix.

Practical defaults to get you running
- Age bins: 16 five-year groups (0–4 … 75+).
- Stages: kE = 2, kI = 2 (good realism with minimal complexity).
- dt: 0.25 day (RK4 stable and accurate for typical parameters).
- β calibration: choose β0 so that R0 matches target via next-generation matrix:
  R0 = ρ(β0 · C · (mean infectious duration)) where ρ is spectral radius.
- Observation: start with a simple fixed reporting delay (Gamma mean 5d, sd 2d) and NegBin with φ ≈ 0.2.

If this sounds good, I can scaffold the Rust crate now with:
- `seirs_ode` core with age structure and Erlang stages.
- `contact` module to load Prem et al. matrices.
- `pop` module to load/aggregate WorldPop-derived populations.
- `calibration` helpers for R0 ↔ β0.
- `observation` module for delayed NB cases.
- Examples in `examples/` showing a single-region run and two-region (proto-spatial) extension.

Success: the project built and the `single_region` example ran, printing a daily CSV with columns:
- day,total_S,total_E,total_I,total_R

What you’re seeing is the aggregate across all age groups for the toy 2-age setup with kE=2, kI=2 and a simple β(t) schedule.

Recommended next steps
- Wire in real data:
  - Population by age from WorldPop aggregates (CSV).
  - Country contact matrix (Prem et al.) as CSV.
- Add unit tests:
  - Mass conservation.
  - Sanity on R0 ↔ beta0 calibration.
- Add CLI flags:
  - --pop <path>, --contact <path>, --r0 <val>, --sigma, --gamma, --omega, --ke, --ki, --dt, --tend.
- Optional: write outputs to a CSV file and per-age breakdowns.

Would you like me to:
- Add a CLI example that reads population and contact matrices from CSV (using the existing `src/io/` loaders), or
- Create sample CSVs and update the example to load them by default?
